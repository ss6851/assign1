Hi @everyone! I have been trying to simulate GET request and have written few lines of code. Following is the function of each python file.

Server.py – acts as our main server which will respond to every request.
Parser.py – parses the request and returns HTTP method and file requested (for now)
codes.py – responds with the appropriate HTTP code. 

Python code for other HTTP requests can be added in server.py when we all collaborate. I suggest we divide subactivities of activity 1 so that everybody can get to learn.

I am using this approach because I think it is modular and scalable, but I might be wrong. Please feel free to suggest any changes.


To execute: run server.py on one terminal and open browser to type: localhost:8080/index.html

P.S. Please name the commit appropriately to specify changes.
